"title": "Vintage Crown Royal Belt Buckle with Purple Crown Royal Bag, Great American Buckle Company, Men&#39;s Texas Buckle, Great Father&#39;s Day Gift!",
"description": "Extra nice vintage Crown Royal belt buckle complete with purple drawstring bag.  This good looking buckle has a raised &quot;Crown Royal&quot; logo over the state of Texas.  I believe it is pewter but I&#39;m not 100% sure about this.  This buckle was made by the Great American Buckle Co. and carries the trade marks on the back.  It measures 2 1/2&quot; by 3 1/4&quot;.  The purple drawstring bag makes a great protector for this and adds to the novelty of it.  Great collectible buckle to add to any collection or beautiful to wear!\n\nThis is a vintage buckle and has wear associated with its age.  It is in overall really great vintage condition and doesn&#39;t appear to me to have ever been worn.  The front have a nice patina and very minimal wear or scratches.  The edges look great with minimal nicks or scratches. The back has a heavier patina and a little tarnish. I haven&#39;t tried to clean it.  The hardware is intact, solid and works fine.  The purple bag is in very nice condition - it may have just a little color fade to it but overall looks good.  Please look at all of my photos and ask should you have any additional questions.\n\nThanks for stopping and browsing.\n\nLooking for another type of belt buckle?

We&#39;ve had 2 items returned to us for incorrect addresses.  One item came back in 2 weeks but the other took 3 months.  If it needs to be resent d/t an incorrect shipping address, the buyer will be responsible for the new postage costs.  \r\n\r\nAll orders are packaged and shipped within 1 - 3 business days after order is placed, although most of the time it will be shipped within 1 day or even the same day if time permits.  We purchase shipping insurance for almost all orders.  We package well to ensure your item arrives undamaged and use whatever materials we feel will best accomplish this.   We use mainly new materials for shipping; boxes, bubble wrap, popcorn, etc. to package our items, but we also may use recycled boxes and materials when we have them available.   If you purchase more than one item we will combine them in the same package if we can do so safely.  If the shipping cost is less than what Etsy has calculated for multiple items and you were overcharged, we will refund the difference if it is greater than a dollar and packaging is not excessive.\r\n\r\nWe try to pre-calculate shipping and packaging charges accurately and in advance but sometimes it does not come out perfectly - it may have been understated or overstated.  Unless specified, if understated, we will pay the difference to get your item to you safely and properly.  If we have overcharged by more than a dollar and the packaging is not  excessive we will refund the overage of the shipping cost back to you. USPS changes shipping charges on occasion and sometimes our older listings have been calculated at a higher rate than current shipping prices.  \r\n\r\nIf you are an out of country purchaser and are interested in an item, if there is no &quot;out of country&quot; shipping price listed, please contact/convo us with your location and we will quote a shipping price for you.  \r\n\r\n*** PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT****\r\nWe use shipping insurance by USPS/priority mail or purchase U-PIC insurance on almost all orders sold.  If by chance something does get lost and doesn&#39;t arrive to you, or an item arrives broken - we will initiate and file a claim with U-PIC or the USPS on your behalf if you would like us to do so.  The buyer can also initiate a claim.  We will refund your purchase price as soon as we receive notification from U-PIC or USPS that you have confirmed with them that the item was lost or damaged.  Please take pictures of the item and packaging if an item arrives to you damaged and contact us immediately.  We have to have pictures of the damages to file a claim.\r\n\r\nThe full set of information regarding U-PIC is available on ETSY in the help section  &quot;shipping insurance&quot;.  They are also available online.  To file a claim with U-PIC for a lost item, there is a waiting period to do so.  Currently, there is a 21 day waiting period in the US, 45 days for international, and 60 days for Italy, although these time frames are subject to change according to U-PIC policies.  A form from U-PIC will be emailed to you (the buyer) that has to be confirmed and signed by the buyer that the item was lost or broken.  Once we are notified the buyer has completed their part of this process we can proceed with your refund.  \r\n\r\nWith USPS Priority mail, a claim for a broken item can be started immediately by the seller or buyer.  Upon receiving notification and pictures of the broken item from the buyer we can do this for you if you would like help.  Usually, it gets processed quicker by the USPS when the buyer initiates the claim.  Please understand when items ship Priority mail, you have purchased the shipping which also includes insurance.  The USPS will need confirmation from the buyer that this item arrived broken.  We are more than happy to assist in processing the claim for you, but we cannot complete the refund for a broken item until we are notified that your end of this process is complete.  Full details for filing a claim or available on the USPS website.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS\r\nInternational shipments are shipped USPS unless otherwise arranged.  U-PIC insurance is purchased by us for every item we ship out of the country.  Import duties, taxes, and charges are NOT INCLUDED in the item price or shipping charges.  These charges are the buyer&#39;s responsibility.  Please check with your country&#39;s customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to purchasing.  These charges are normally collected by the delivering freight (shipping) company or when you pick the item up - do not confuse them for additional shipping charges.  We will not mark merchandise prices below the cost you purchased at unless we have refunded a portion of the cost.  We will not mark items as &quot;gifts&quot;.  US and International government regulations prohibit such behavior.  \r\n",

Do not send an item back without first contacting us - no refund will be given if this occurs and we will not pay additional postage to send it back to you again.  We must be contacted within 3 days of tracking received date of item if you would like to request a refund.  \r\n\r\nIf agreed upon between the buyer and seller, the item will be returned to us at the buyer&#39;s expense.  Shipping with tracking and insurance needs to commence within 3 business days of the agreed upon return.  We&#39;ve had to implement these time frames in our refund policy for multiple reasons and no exceptions will be allowed.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt and examination of the item, a refund will be issued to the buyer for the purchase price only.

Each piece is individually bubble wrapped and all contents are packed tight. Glass is risky to ship, so I always take the time to do the best packing possible. (Rarely accidents happen, so I always save your images just in case another piece is needed.)\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ By purchasing this listing you are agreeing to the store&#39;s terms found in the &quot;Shipping & Policies&quot; tab within this listing. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",

"title": "3 Liter Engraved Bourbon Barrel: great gift for men",
"description": "Looking for a unique birthday, Valentine&#39;s Day or wedding gift for a man? The 3 liter mini handcrafted whiskey/bourbon barrel cask might be just what the doctor ordered. The barrel hold 3 liters and is crafted from Kentucky and American Oak wood with steel hoops going around it (your choice of silver or black steel). No previous knowledge of expertise of blending is needed because each barrel comes with its own set of detailed guidelines for using and cleaning. The barrel can also be used to make or store your own varieties of wine, rum and tequila! Each barrel measures 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; and comes with its own hand carved wood stand.\r\n\r\nThe barrels are also offered in 2 liter size: http://www.etsy.com/listing/94178325/engraved-mini-whiskey-barrel-great-for and  1 liter size: http://www.etsy.com/listing/101458387/1-liter-personalized-mini-whiskey-barrel\r\n\r\nWHAT&#39;S THE PROCESS?\r\nThe process is very simple. Before the barrel&#39;s first use, you&#39;ll have to perform the curing (cleaning) it. The included instructions will thoroughly explain how to do this. It&#39;s very easy. Once the barrel is cured, fill it with your favorite whiskey or bourbon. For extra flavor, add extra ingredients like cinnamon sticks, apple chips, honey and chocolate. After this, it&#39;s up to you to determine how long you let everything sit. Once you&#39;ve finished one batch, you can empty your creation into a decanter and restart the process. If you&#39;re not a big whiskey drinker, you can also use the barrels to blend or store your own wine, rum and tequila. \r\n\r\nENGRAVING OPTIONS\r\nI will engrave the front of your barrel(s) at no extra cost. There is a visual example of the 4 engraving style in the product images above. Please select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. Your options are are:\r\n1. Standard Initials\r\n2. Monogram (small first name initial, large last name initial, small middle name initial)\r\n3. One or Two Custom Lines of Text (max of 15 characters per line)\r\n4. Single Large Initial\r\n\r\n*You can also select blank and not have any engraving on the barrel.\r\n** Please note that &quot;standard initials&quot; and &quot;monogram&quot; aren&#39;t the same thing.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SEND ME YOUR ENGRAVING REQUEST(S)\r\nPlease select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. When finalizing your order, you&#39;ll have the ability to include a &quot;message to seller&quot;. Use this area to tell me what you want engraved on your barrel(s). If I don&#39;t receive a message with your engraving request, it will be assumed you want your barrel to arrive without engraving.\r\n\r\nORDERING MORE THAN 1 BARREL?\r\nYou can select your quantity at this page or at checkout.\r\n\r\nSHIPMENT\r\nOrders are currently shipping out  approximately 2-3 business days after you order. After this, there are another 2-4 business days in transit via UPS Ground.  If you need a rush order, please contact me BEFORE ORDERING to discuss available options.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\r\nCanadian customers are free to make a purchase through this page with the already-provided shipping costs. Your ship time will increase by 1-2 business days versus an order going to the US.  For residents of other countries, please message me with your address and the number of barrels you want. After I have this info, I can provide you a shipping quote and we can complete the transaction.\r\n\r\nSHOP POLICIES & FAQ\r\nFor answers to common questions on this product, shipping timeframes, refunds and other details, please consult with this page: http://www.etsy.com/shop/themanregistry/policy",

Please message me for details.\r\n\r\nQ - Do you guarantee the lead and ship times listed above.\r\nA - I never guarantee a delivery date when an item ships via UPS Ground. This is because the activity on UPS&#39; end is out of my hands. If you need an item by a specific date, please contact me to discuss guaranteed options. We may need to add a rush to the order and use a shipping method quicker than Ground.\r\n\r\nQ - What is rush service and how much is it?\r\nA - Rush service cuts down the lead time for an order. Instead of the stated lead time for a product, the order will go out sooner with a rush. The fee for this is $20 due to the expedited work that has to be done on my end. Please contact me  BEFORE ORDERING to discuss placing a rush order.\r\n\r\nQ - How do I send you my personalization request(s)?\r\nA - Great question. If you&#39;re ordering an item that can be engraved or personalized in any way, please create a &quot;message to seller&quot; while checking out. You can write your personalization requests in this message. If I don&#39;t receive this message, it will be assumed you don&#39;t want any personalization for your order.\r\n\r\nQ - Is there an extra charge to ship to Hawaii or Alaska?\r\nA - Yes, I do charge a $20 fee for these orders due to high ship costs. I&#39;ll contact you after the order to arrange payment.\r\n\r\nQ - Can you ship to a PO box?\r\nA - Unfortunately, I cannot ship to PO boxes or APO addresses.\r\n\r\nBOURBON BARREL FAQ\r\nQ - I just received my barrel but the hoops are loose. What do I do?\r\nA - This is normal. Once the barrel is cured, it will expanding thus tightening the hoops. Detailed instructions for curing are included with every barrel.\r\n\r\nQ - Why does my barrel look slightly different from the ones in the product photos? OR I ordered several barrels and they all look slightly similar.\r\nA - Since no two pieces of wood are exactly alike, no two barrels will be exactly alike. The varying grain level and thickness of wood gives each barrel it&#39;s own unique, charming look.\r\n\r\nQ - What engraving font do you use on the barrels?\r\nA - Times New Roman Bold.\r\n\r\nQ - Can my engraving be done curved around the top and bottom of the barrel face?\r\nA - Unfortunately, not. The only engraving formats I&#39;m set up to do are listed on the product listing and featured in the product images.\r\n\r\nQ - Are the barrels charred?\r\nA - Yes, the barrels are charred with a medium level (2-3) char.\r\n\r\nQ - My barrel is leaking, what should I do?\r\nA - It&#39;s normal for a barrel that hasn&#39;t been cured to leak. Before using the barrel, you must first seal it by following the curing process that&#39;s detailed in the included instructions.\r\n\r\nQ - Is there a limit to how many times the barrel can be filled?\r\nA - The barrel can be filled an unlimited number of times. For the purposes of aging your own spirit blends, you&#39;ll get the best results from the first four fills.\r\n\r\nQ - I filled my barrel but now it&#39;s empty!?!? What happened?\r\nA - Either someone in your home has been sneaking drinks OR you didn&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up as the instructions say to. If you don&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up, the top will get dry and evaporation will occur.\r\n\r\nQ - Why did my barrel turn a weird bluish looking color after curing it?\r\nA - This happens in less than 1% of barrels. The cause is related to the the ions in water negatively reacting to the metal thus the black bleeding onto the barrel.  There is no health risk, but please contact me if this occurs. \r\n\r\nCHALKBOARD MUG FAQ\r\nQ - If I  buy a chalkboard mug, can you write a message on it for me?\r\nA - We&#39;ve attempted to include chalk-written messages on mugs in the past, but the writing does smudge during shipping. We&#39;re happy to try -- but we think it&#39;s going to look much better if it arrives blank vs. being smudged up.\r\n\r\nOAK BARREL MUG FAQ\r\nQ - Are the mugs toasted?\r\nA - Yes, they are lightly toasted.\r\n\r\nQ - Why is my mug leaking?\r\nA - As stated on the product listing, you must cure the mug before use. Curing instructions are included with each mug. If you&#39;ve misplaced yours,  you can do the following: fill the mug with hot water and keep it filled for two days until it stops leaking, or until you don&#39;t see the water level change after 24 hours.\r\n\r\nQ - Can the mugs be engraved?\r\nA - Unfortunately, my equipment isn&#39;t set up to engrave the barrel mugs. My suggestion is to make your purchase and have them engraved locally.\r\n\r\nQ - How do I clean my mug between uses?\r\nA - You can hand wash the mugs with warm water and perfume-free dish detergent.\r\n\r\nWOODEN SIX PACK CARRIER FAQ\r\nQ - Can I engrave multiple initials on this product? On both sides?\r\nA - Unfortunately, I can only engrave a single large initial on one side of the product. This is due to the way my equipment is set up.",

Chymiera has been serving you and selling on etsy for almost 6 fantastic years, but we have decided to look at different prospects.  We have a new brand called The Conjury¬© and our debut will start at TheConjury.com  \r\nWhat this means is that we will slowly be porting over our merchandise to our new website, and that may take months or even a year. We will not quit Etsy cold turkey in case you&#39;re wondering -- we just will not be adding new merchandise here in our Etsy shop. If you would like to see our exciting new merchandise, please check out our new website.  Until we have completely moved to the new website, all things in this shop are now 25% off.  This includes merchandise that is already on sale!!  This will help us out tremendously, as the more you purchase here, the less we have to port over. All you need to do is enter coupon code CRUISIN and it will automatically deduct 25% off your order!

Offer things from simple affordable to high end jewelry, so that everbody can enjoy a bit of happiness, beauty and Chymiera love, one piece at a time :)\r\n\r\n‚ú¶Raw & Natural elements are our fundamentals creating unique jewelry, engagement rings & wedding bands in Fine jewelry in gold, palladium & sterling silver jewelry using the lost wax technique, often paired with precious & semi-precious gemstones.\r\n\r\n‚ú¶Custom Orders, always welcome.  We specialize in unique alchemy requests and  one of a kind handmade and hand cast jewelry. We use the &quot;lost wax&quot; technique for casting charms, pendant, rings, etc...    What inspires us  are the questionable things,  of this earth in folklore, ancient mythology, magic , dark romance, legend and tales of old including: dieties, shaman, werewolves, vampires, fairies, aparitions, shapeshifters, changelings, hobbits, wizards, voodoo, magic and more\r\nFrom this inspiration we create masterpieces or manifestations- if you will- of necklaces, earrings,  bracelets, anklets and other curious trinkets.   \r\nWe tend to push the envelope so to speak on the darker side of things as well, and go to depths of creation others do not dare. We are unafraid, and enjoy being mischievous. We also however do offer some pieces on the lighter side as well. \r\nSo , you see, there is something here for everyone!\r\nWe hope you love our little Shop and hope you will come visit quite often!\r\nWe love AOK&#39;s and PIF&#39;s, if there is something in our shoppe you Love, but cant quite afford, convo us with your best offer, we will see what we can do for you! \r\n\r\n‚ú¶We Do Layaway on larger ticket items, ask us about the terms!\r\n\r\n‚ú¶If you are ordering a custom ring and need to know your size, here is a guide just print  it & size away!\r\nhttp://pages.ebay.com/buy/guides/ring-sizing-guide/#2\r\n‚ú¶Also, we now offer loaner ring sizers.

And all of our animal parts come either from a  licensed taxidermist or from our own finds during our woodland excursions in The . Please know your country&#39;s or your state&#39;s laws on ownership of animal parts, furs & bones. It is up to the buyer to do their homework about laws pertaining to ownership of animal parts. Any customs taxes or penalties for these types of purchases are the sole responsibilty of the buyer. I do not accept returns or give refunds if your item gets held by customs in your country.\r\n\r\n‚ú¶Allergy Info:: we often send lavender or other scented sachets with orders    as a thank you gift, please notify us if you would prefer not to receive one.\r\n\r\n‚ú¶ Any questions you might have,  please do not hesitate to ask.  \r\n",

If you would prefer a different shipping method, please contact me for an updated price prior to purchasing.\r\nIf you live where others have taken your mail or  have access to your mail, I would suggest getting me to add signature confirmation so that only you can get your package, that will be an additional $2.00\r\n If your package becomes lost or stolen, I will work diligently with you to locate it!\r\nAs of late, packages running through the usps have been delayed, please know that once I ship your package, I have no control over how fast the post office will handle your package, but I will do everything within my power to track it, as everything I ship will come with tracking. Larger priced items will be insured for my protection.\r\n‚ú¶INTERNATIONAL FRIENDS:\r\nMy shipping quotes are as follows:\r\nMost of my listings will accurately let you know what the shipping cost is.\r\nBut the general policies are as follows::\r\nFirst Class Mail - includes a tracking number that can only be tracked while still in the US. Your package may take up to 6 weeks to arrive. If you would like me to add signature confirmation, that will be an additional $13.65\r\nPriority Mail-  Usually take anywhere from 5 to 14 business days. Maybe longer during the holidays. Has a tracking number only trackable within the US. Again, Please contact me to add to shipping if you would like your item with signature confirmation\r\nExpress mail- Usually arrives within 3-7 business days, maybe longer during the holidays. Tracking only shows up while still in the US. Express mail comes with $100 insurance. I try to adjust the shipping to accommodate the insurance cost for higher priced items. If you are not sure, just ask me! :)\r\n\r\n‚ú¶All of my pieces, will come to you packaged securely and presented in a gift box, wrapped and ready for gift giving or keeping for yourself. :)\r\n\r\n‚ú¶I will communicate to you through the Etsy Conversations to let you know when your item has shipped. \r\nReady made items will ship within 1-3 business days once payment has cleared. \r\n\r\n‚ú¶Items that are made to order will take longer. Please check the actual listing for current turn-around time.\r\n \r\n‚ú¶The item will be sent to the address listed on your ETSY ACCOUNT. \r\nTo avoid confusion, please make sure the address/es on both your PayPal account and your Etsy account are current. If you would prefer it to be shipped elsewhere, please contact me- and do so promptly if you have already placed the order- we ship like lightning on most items!\r\n \r\n‚ú¶IF YOU NEED YOUR ITEM BY A CERTAIN DATE, please let me know. I will let you know if this is possible, and we can arrange different shipping options.\r\nSince I live in an &quot;extended area&quot; the post office is always my first choice for hipping, however, I can ship UPS or FEDEX, but either of those is about a 30 minute drive for me, so in addition to shipping, there will be a travel fee. This usually would only occur on larger items.",
"policy_refunds": "‚ú¶INTEGRITY OF GOODS:\r\nAll handmade pieces are thoroughly inspected by us (We are both ChYMieRa) before they go out.

So, you may certainly wait for that too.\r\n\r\n**The fine print: Once a winner is declared, The &quot;Riddle&quot; listing winner will go through checkout as normal up to &quot;Commit To Buy&quot; and click &quot;other&quot; as form of payment.   Payment will be marked as received, and we (ChYMieRa) are responsible for paying all Etsy related fees including a final value fee of the  original listing price. We do not partake in fee avoidance.\r\nNo fees will be paid by winner including shipping unless an alternate shipping option other than how we normally ship is chosen. We ship First Class Mail with delivery confirmation. Friends, Family, Associates and Affiliates of ChYMieRa are not eligible to participate in this game. No purchase necessary to win. Clues can be found in other active listings.  However one free clue is provided to the purchaser of every sale. For every additional item  bought by the same user, an additional clue per item will be sent. US residents Only.\r\n\r\n‚ú¶Allergy Info:: we often send lavender or other scented sachets with orders    as a thank you gift, please notify us if you would prefer not to receive one.\r\n",

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday.

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\n*Expedited orders will come from our Hong Kong shop. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  ",

Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",
